# Card Fraud Rule Engine Documentation

Quarkus runtime for fraud decision evaluation and compiled ruleset execution.

## Audience

- New developers setting up this repository locally.
- Coding agents that need deterministic, executable setup/test instructions.

## Quick Start

```powershell
uv sync
uv run doppler-local
uv run test-unit
```

## Documentation Standards

- Keep published docs inside `docs/01-setup` through `docs/07-reference`.
- Use lowercase kebab-case file names (for example `local-setup.md`).
- Exceptions: `README.md`, `codemap.md`, and machine-generated contract files (for example `openapi.json`).
- Do not publish TODO, session notes, or archive artifacts.
